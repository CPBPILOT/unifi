# WTF Unifi Scripts

Starting point for my Unifi scripts



## [nut-client](nut-client)
Basic configuration for [Network UPS Tool](https://networkupstools.org) (NUT) client

## [wpa_supplicant](wpa_supplicant)
This script does not use the podman method that was depricated by Unifi some time ago and works directly on the hardware's debian OS.
