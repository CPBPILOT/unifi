# WTF Unifi

A repository for my Unfi-related content.

## [draw.io libraries](draw-io)
Ubiquiti libraries for Draw.io

## [nut-client](nut-client)
Basic configuration for [Network UPS Tool](https://networkupstools.org) (NUT) client

## [splunk_forwarder](splunk_forwarder)
A script to setup the splunk-forwader service.

## [wpa_supplicant](wpa_supplicant)
Check/repair/install the wpa_supplicant setup on UDM hardware with formatted status messages and logging.
This does not use the podman method depricated by Unifi some time ago and works directly on the hardware's debian OS.
